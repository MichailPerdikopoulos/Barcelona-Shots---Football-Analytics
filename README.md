# Analyzing Lionel Messi's Dominance in La Liga Using Python and Power BI #
Welcome to my football analytics project! This repository contains the Python code and Power BI report I used to analyze Lionel Messi's performance in La Liga.

# Project Overview #
As a data analyst and football fan, I wanted to explore the reasons behind Lionel Messi's unparalleled success in La Liga. To do that, I used Statsbomb API to collect data for all of Messi's shots and goals in La Liga from 2004o 2021. Then, I transformed the data into a dynamic Power BI report that offers a granular analysis of every shot, goal, and expected goal for every year, opponent, and shot type.

The report showcases Messi's game-changing moments, including how he outperformed the expected goal model in his prime years. It provides valuable insights into Messi's playing style, his strengths and weaknesses, and his impact on his team's performance.

# Acknowledgments #
I would like to thank the Statsbomb team for providing the data used in this project. The Statsbomb API through the python library offers a huge amount of data useful for every data analyst to study and experiment on football analytics. It is the best resource to use for any project and I can't wait for my next one! You can find detailed information on the [official documentation](https://github.com/statsbomb/statsbombpy).

Futhermore, I would like to thank the team behind mplsoccer. Mplsoccer is a Python library for plotting soccer/football charts in Matplotlib and loading StatsBomb open-data. It offers a great variety of tools to easily create amazing visualization of high quality. You can find detailed information on the [official documentation](https://mplsoccer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

I cannot higlight enough the importance and help of these two libraries! I suggest you use them as soon as possible!

# Getting Started #
## Prerequisites ##
To run the Python code, you need to install the following libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- seaborn
- statsbombpy
- mplsoccer
- pywaffle

To open and interact with the Power BI report, you need to install Power BI Desktop.

## Installing ##
To install the required libraries for Python, you can use pip. In order to install pandas, open your terminal and type:

```
pip install pandas
```

The same command is used for all the necessary python libraries.

To install Power BI Desktop, go to the Microsoft website and follow the instructions.
